# EVE Market Fun

A poorly-named project for playing with EVE Online market data from node.js

## TODO

* Need "loading" indicators everywhere - market order grids, selectors, etc.

* "Shopping cart"
    * Shopping cart is always around - maybe localStorage?
    * Like a scratchpad, temporary & easily cleared
    * Can be loaded from items anywhere
    * Save to / load from persistent named lists
    * Load from textarea paste - to import fits & etc
    * Associate amount with each item
    * Instant appraisal from a location market prices
    * Compare prices from several favorite locations
    * Market scan on shopping cart - iterate through market details on cart

* Inventory tracking

* Need item & location autocomplete widgets

* Merge static database tables with main dynamic DB

* Wrap everything user-related in a login required trap middleware

* Solar system search and autocomplete

* Item browsing search
